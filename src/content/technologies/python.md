Python plays several roles in my work. Perhaps its most visible place in my day-to-day interactions is within Jupyter Notebooks, which I use as a home base for exploring a new dataset, querying idea, machine learning experiment, or any other data-centric task. `Pandas` and `numpy` are essential here. 

I have written and deployed many [microservices](/technologies/microservices) based on `flask` (usually under `waitress`, then proxied by [nginx](/technologies/nginx)) for internal APIs to serve applications; many of these additionally used [GraphQL](/technologies/graphql) on the endpoint.  In other cases, Python takes on the task of mapping very large relational databases (Oracle at the university) into object structures, and then somtimes into a graph form or dumped into something like [MongoDB](/technologies/nosql) for further use, often on a nightly schedule. 

I have also contributed heavily to integrating Python-based data work and data science into [workflows that rely on SAS](/technologies/sas).

As for typing, I have flirted often with adopting the type system that has at least partial native support, but due to its tooling integration (or, the apparent awkwardness of its tooling compared to Typescript for nodejs / javascript) I have not yet used its type system in any major project. Given my increasing preference for more tightly typed languages (see also [rust](/technologies/rust)), adapting my Python workflow in that direction is a current initiative.
