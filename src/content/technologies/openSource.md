Having worked to rapidly build solutions [in higher education](/employment/alabama) for over a decade, I've watched the radical transformation of open-source software from a loose and often risky set of siloed projects (spread across SourceForge, etc) to a remarkably well-tuned machine of tight dependencies and versioning (`npm` and `cargo` being excellent examples), automated unit & integration testing in public view (e.g. TravisCI), languages iterating in their support and syntax abstractions at remarkable speed (Javascript through and beyond ES6 alongside Babel and Typescript; the acension of `rust`), and libraries that are first-tier in development for commercial products and small work alike (ReactJS). 

Moving into consulting for [start-ups](/employment/overlayai) in the past several years has permitted an even deeper engagement with the new world of development, and with the smooth work of remote collaboration enabled by these excellent tools. Across all the technology pages of this site, you'll also see mentions of my scattered open-source contributions--and I'd love to push even more code into public view whenever the company and project permits.
