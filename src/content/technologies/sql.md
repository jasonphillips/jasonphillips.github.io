Working in a data-centric role at the University and often being tasked with projects that combine ETL, descriptive statistics or insights, and conversion, integration, or presentation, I have a long established fluency in writing efficient queries, designing well-thought-out tables and schemas, indexes, triggers and views, orchestrating migrations and conversions, and offering end-to-end expertise on the data practices for projects that require a relational kind of storage (though not all projects or phases need it, and I happily opt for [nosql](/technologies/nosql) solutions when that is the case).

My most involved work has typically been with Oracle, simply due to the University using it as their primary licensed system and internally supported platform, but I have plenty of experience with Postgres and regrettably MySQL. An alternative solution that I continue to favor for very small projects or rapidly designed prototypes is `SQLite`, which I will often, for instance, spin up to load datasets and deploy a Flask-based endpoint rapidly in Python when handed some partial data or proof-of-concept store. 

Often I work with [translating relational structures into objects or vice versa](/technologies/orm), and a great solution for rethinking SQL databases and the way they are exposed to a wider application is to map them into a [graphql](/technologies/graphql) endpoint.
