Ruby is primarily a language that I have used for building and scripting purposes, rather than deploying it onto a server. The primary framework through I built a number of static sites is `middleman`, which can be summed up as giving you the asset pipeline of `rails` (and immediate, easy access to using `haml`, `sass`, image assets, static data, whatever else you need) for projects that are built into static assets in development. I have also used `jekyll` for this purpose, but `middleman` is consideraly more mature and expansive in its options.

One major project for which I used `middleman` was UA's [unified accreditation report](/projects/accreditation), in which case I generated a massive number of pages spanning many different embedded data presentations (some using `react` or other tools for reporting). 

Over time, I have tended to supplant those tools with alternatives like `gatsby` (see: [static sites](/technologies/staticSites)), so ruby no longer represents a major factor in my work.
