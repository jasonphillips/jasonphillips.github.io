Node.js is one of the environments I utilize most frequently in applications when an endpoint or API is needed (unless I opt for python, which typically would only be chosen if the task calls for certain requirements like [machine learning](/technologies/machineLearning)). I have deployed many `express` applications with REST, GraphQL, and work-queue driven or imperative APIs exposed to other services. Typically, [statelessness](/technologies/microservices) is a driving goal wherever possible, and I prefer JWTs alongside clean, versioned routing conventions. 

Today I typically begin any new node project with `typescript`, as I do on the front-end, and am adept at writing intelligent [unit tests](/technologies/testing).

Other uses of Node.js in my prior projects include isomorphic apps with server-side rendering in [React](/technologies/react), building [ORM-like](/technologies/orm) tools to move between massive university relational databases and clean objects, and proxying or wrapping other services like `elasticsearch` for exposed APIs. I have also developed [web assembly](/technologies/wasm) code, typically in [rust](/technologies/rust), to run equivalently and efficiently as part of an isomorphic pipeline for the client and Node.js on the server.
