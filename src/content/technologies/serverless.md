"Serverless" is a framework in which I have only more recently worked, after engaging in concerns and debates regarding the value or reality of it "server-free" concept. That said, after moving [an application backend](/projects/browserNLP) entirely onto AWS Lambda with paired development and production environments--all by writing clean and reusable `terraform` files--I'm at least convinced of its viability for certain use-cases. It's certainly not as painless an abstraction as its usual pitch will promise, and poses all new difficulties, but the reality is that it beats Kubernetes deployments at least in the areas of price, scalability, and overall weight. I plan to dive further in future work, when appropriate.
