Working in a consulting role for the startup Overlay AI has meant diving fully into the latest state-of-the-art for NLP in a number of domains, and working to efficiently build an entire pipeline in a resource-constrained context--going from tokenization, though tagging, stemming, lemmatization, dependency parsing, and then applying top-level rules or vector-space comparisons, all within a chain of WASM-compiled tools running in a background WebWorker.
