Working for the Office of Institutional Research, my role this past decade has been to construct numerous data-heavy applications, integration layers, and dynamic presentations, either for the campus community, the administration, or for external bodies and accreditors. As leader of a small web-focused team, I have hired and supervised junior developers and graduate students across many projects, spearheading all technical decisions and carrying out projects from initial idea through to stakeholder presentations and deployments. 

Selected projects: [Credential Mapping](/projects/credentials), [Admissions Tracking & Visualizations](/projects/admissionsTracking), [Unified Syllabus Editor](/projects/textEditors), [Dynamic Data Reporting](/projects/dynamicReporting), [Survey Text Analysis](/projects/surveyText), [Accreditation Preparation](/projects/accreditation), [Committee Staffing](/projects/committees), [Tuition Remission](/projects/tuitionRemission)
