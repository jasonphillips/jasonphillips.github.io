Having conducted many technical interviews over the past decade, and knowing how difficult it is to grasp an applicant's capabilities from a list of bullet points without at least hearing them walk through past projects, I constructed this site to offer background information on many areas of my work--although it is necessarily far from comprehensive. Please explore the links above, but do not hesitate to contact me for further information. References available upon request.
