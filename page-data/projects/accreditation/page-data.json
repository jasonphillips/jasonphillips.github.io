The need for central indexing meant keeping to a strict markdown formatting for all footnotes (indicating type of content clearly) and then building scripts to scan and collect all of these across all of the current markdown drafts, generating a finalized indexed list and finding potential overlaps in sources;</li>\n<li><strong>Some pages require more visual presentations to be embedded</strong>: for write-ups that include complex tables or charts, I typically embedded custom mini-<code>React</code> implementations as needed in different sections, each with a clear directive as to what must appear in the corresponding markdown, typically as something like a list of the stats to be shown so that a non-interactive view (PDF or paper copy) contains the same information as the web presentation; </li>\n<li><strong>Daily builds must be available internally</strong>: given the above decision to employ a static site, this was relatively easy, but did depend upon maintaining a clear daily pipeline to latest bulids.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On top of the above, I also personally headed up the entire project of reconciling, documenting, and justifying the matching between all faculty or instructor credentials and teaching assignments over an entire year period, an undertaking which I have <a href=\"/projects/credentials\">documented elsewhere</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Accreditation Preparation","tags":null,"parent":null}},"tags":{"nodes":[]}},"pageContext":{"tags":[]}}}
