I spearheaded the move from Meteor’s prior pub/sub data layer (DDP, based essentially on MongoDB oplog tailing) to <a href=\"/technologies/graphql\">graphql</a>, writing an entirely new, comprehensive schema, mutations, side-effects logic, subscription code, and front-end integrations with the developing set of <code>apollo</code> tools (whose rapid internal shifts and pitfalls I was often involved in tracking through its codebase or <a href=\"https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/700/files\">fixing</a>). </p>\n<p>After moving fully into graphql for the core <a href=\"/technologies/mongodb\">MongoDB</a> database, I later took advantage of graphql’s extensibility to begin building and connecting a <code>postgres</code> instance, incorporating a design driven more by event-sourcing to counter the loose mutability of Mongo; for that integration, I relied on a tool of which I’ve increasingly grown fond, <code>join-monster</code>, to make the <a href=\"/technologies/orm\">relational-to-graph mapping</a> work smoothy. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Meteor","tags":["graphql","react","mongodb"],"competence":"advanced","parent":null}},"tags":{"nodes":[{"id":"7a9da462-1ce0-5f4a-b6d0-3a9bf147171d","fields":{"slug":"/technologies/graphql","tag":"graphql"},"frontmatter":{"title":"GraphQL"}},{"id":"715705b3-cc96-5459-b34f-93ae8ed8939c","fields":{"slug":"/technologies/mongodb","tag":"mongodb"},"frontmatter":{"title":"MongoDB"}},{"id":"97c03e57-9ce8-5f83-ab7e-6d87587a8f41","fields":{"slug":"/technologies/react","tag":"react"},"frontmatter":{"title":"React"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tags":["graphql","react","mongodb"]}}}
