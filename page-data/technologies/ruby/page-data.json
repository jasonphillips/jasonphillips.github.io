The primary framework through I built a number of static sites is <code>middleman</code>, which can be summed up as giving you the asset pipeline of <code>rails</code> (and immediate, easy access to using <code>haml</code>, <code>sass</code>, image assets, static data, whatever else you need) for projects that are built into static assets in development. I have also used <code>jekyll</code> for this purpose, but <code>middleman</code> is consideraly more mature and expansive in its options.</p>\n<p>One major project for which I used <code>middleman</code> was UAâ€™s <a href=\"/projects/accreditation\">unified accreditation report</a>, in which case I generated a massive number of pages spanning many different embedded data presentations (some using <code>react</code> or other tools for reporting). </p>\n<p>Over time, I have tended to supplant those tools with alternatives like <code>gatsby</code> (see: <a href=\"/technologies/staticSites\">static sites</a>), so ruby no longer represents a major factor in my work. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ruby","tags":["staticSites"],"competence":null,"parent":null}},"tags":{"nodes":[{"id":"f0a8cc6a-186c-5a26-85c5-f589de249305","fields":{"slug":"/technologies/staticSites","tag":"staticSites"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Static Site Generation"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tags":["staticSites"]}}}
