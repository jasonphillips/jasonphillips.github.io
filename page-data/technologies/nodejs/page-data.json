I have deployed many <code>express</code> applications with REST, GraphQL, and work-queue driven or imperative APIs exposed to other services. Typically, <a href=\"/technologies/microservices\">statelessness</a> is a driving goal wherever possible, and I prefer JWTs alongside clean, versioned routing conventions. </p>\n<p>Today I typically begin any new node project with <code>typescript</code>, as I do on the front-end, and am adept at writing intelligent <a href=\"/technologies/testing\">unit tests</a>.</p>\n<p>Other uses of Node.js in my prior projects include isomorphic apps with server-side rendering in <a href=\"/technologies/react\">React</a>, building <a href=\"/technologies/orm\">ORM-like</a> tools to move between massive university relational databases and clean objects, and proxying or wrapping other services like <code>elasticsearch</code> for exposed APIs. I have also developed <a href=\"/technologies/wasm\">web assembly</a> code, typically in <a href=\"/technologies/rust\">rust</a>, to run equivalently and efficiently as part of an isomorphic pipeline for the client and Node.js on the server. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Node.js","tags":["microservices","graphql"],"competence":"advanced","parent":null}},"tags":{"nodes":[{"id":"7a9da462-1ce0-5f4a-b6d0-3a9bf147171d","fields":{"slug":"/technologies/graphql","tag":"graphql"},"frontmatter":{"title":"GraphQL"}},{"id":"0c42cc39-d1e0-5c3a-b643-7b0473ecf678","fields":{"slug":"/technologies/microservices","tag":"microservices"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Microservices"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tags":["microservices","graphql"]}}}
