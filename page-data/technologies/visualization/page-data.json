Often I will happily hook up existing visualizations from various popular packages like <code>recharts</code>, but just as often I end up writing new visualizations to target our specific needs. For this purpose, my primary starting point was typically D3, but its somewhat less-than-desirable integration with Reactâ€™s tree (though I have created <a href=\"https://jasonphillips.github.io/react-likert/\">various React experiments</a> to integrate it into the DOM / virtual DOM in different ways) has increasingly led me to simply draw the <code>svg</code> layer directly from React, but using an animation library to get the desired effects (and careful memoing). </p>\n<p>When exploring a dataset for my own purposes and examining its contents, I most often begin instead with <a href=\"/technologies/python\">Jupyter notebooks</a>, which even offer a perfectly acceptable space to embed a bit of exploratory D3 after slicing and plotting. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I once wrote an entire animated mini-film as a gift to my wife coded <em>entirely</em> in vanilla D3 code, using a hand-calculated camera / parallax / zooming scene system, photo assets of her artwork with many svg filters and distortions applied, and more tricks. D3 is a strange choice for the job, but it made for an enjoyable experiment. <a href=\"/misc/ichabod\">Watch the first 30 seconds here</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Data Visualization","tags":["react","python","opensource"],"competence":null,"parent":null}},"tags":{"nodes":[{"id":"46cc03d9-b4a8-5918-ab98-763d457a1e09","fields":{"slug":"/technologies/python","tag":"python"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Python"}},{"id":"97c03e57-9ce8-5f83-ab7e-6d87587a8f41","fields":{"slug":"/technologies/react","tag":"react"},"frontmatter":{"title":"React"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tags":["react","python","opensource"]}}}
