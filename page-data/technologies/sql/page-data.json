An alternative solution that I continue to favor for very small projects or rapidly designed prototypes is <code>SQLite</code>, which I will often, for instance, spin up to load datasets and deploy a Flask-based endpoint rapidly in Python when handed some partial data or proof-of-concept store. </p>\n<p>Often I work with <a href=\"/technologies/orm\">translating relational structures into objects or vice versa</a>, and a great solution for rethinking SQL databases and the way they are exposed to a wider application is to map them into a <a href=\"/technologies/graphql\">graphql</a> endpoint. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"SQL and Relational Databases","tags":["orm","python","graphql","nosql"],"competence":"advanced","parent":null}},"tags":{"nodes":[{"id":"7a9da462-1ce0-5f4a-b6d0-3a9bf147171d","fields":{"slug":"/technologies/graphql","tag":"graphql"},"frontmatter":{"title":"GraphQL"}},{"id":"f9888291-b28c-5fc9-928e-201d21684acc","fields":{"slug":"/technologies/nosql","tag":"nosql"},"frontmatter":{"title":"NoSQL Databases"}},{"id":"622fc898-6f2e-5531-8c13-a6c7b9742750","fields":{"slug":"/technologies/orm","tag":"orm"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ORM(s)"}},{"id":"46cc03d9-b4a8-5918-ab98-763d457a1e09","fields":{"slug":"/technologies/python","tag":"python"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Python"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tags":["orm","python","graphql","nosql"]}}}
