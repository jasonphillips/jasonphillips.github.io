But itâ€™s worth remembering the total paradigm shift that so influenced me to strike out in new directions once I first had the chance to treat web services as individual port-claiming micro applications under the routing of <a href=\"/technologies/nginx\">nginx</a>, and could cleanly architect systems bridging technologies like <a href=\"/technologies/nodejs\">nodejs</a> and <a href=\"/technologies/python\">python</a> with ease. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Legacy Technologies","tags":[],"competence":"advanced","parent":null}},"tags":{"nodes":[]}},"pageContext":{"tags":[]}}}
