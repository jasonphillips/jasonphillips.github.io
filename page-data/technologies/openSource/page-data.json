Across all the technology pages of this site, you’ll also see mentions of my scattered open-source contributions—and I’d love to push even more code into public view whenever the company and project permits. </p>\n<p>Pages featuring links to public contributions on Github (look for links with the <a href=\"https://jasonphillips.github.io\">icon</a>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/technologies/testing\">Automated Testing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/projects/textEditors\">Text Editors</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/technologies/graphql\">GraphQL</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/technologies/react\">React</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/technologies/sas\">SAS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/technologies/orm\">ORM</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/technologies/visualization\">Data Visualization</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/technologies/cpp\">C++</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/technologies/staticSites\">Static Sites</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/technologies/rabbitmq\">RabbitMQ</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Open Source Development","tags":["nodejs","python","rust"],"competence":"advanced","parent":null}},"tags":{"nodes":[{"id":"a09e8c4d-4270-59cc-86dd-694aa938075b","fields":{"slug":"/technologies/nodejs","tag":"nodejs"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Node.js"}},{"id":"46cc03d9-b4a8-5918-ab98-763d457a1e09","fields":{"slug":"/technologies/python","tag":"python"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Python"}},{"id":"d4ca853c-81ba-5b63-a722-45cea24afa97","fields":{"slug":"/technologies/rust","tag":"rust"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rust"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tags":["nodejs","python","rust"]}}}
